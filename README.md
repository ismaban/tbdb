# Description
This is a project I have been working on to learn the basics of front-end development with the following technologies:
- React.js (front-end)
- Tailwind (CSS and UI)
- Axios (consume an API)

# The Project
This project is a book repository, based on OpenLibrary's API (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).
As an End-User you can enter any book-title, and OpenLibrary will return:
- book cover
- book title
- published year
- book ISBN
- book author

In addition, the background of the page will update with a blurred-version of the book cover (in (very) modern browsers only)


# Next Steps
 There is still plenty to do, in order to make this a full fledged app:
 - improve the behaviour of the {SearchList} component
 - find another API which provides the book description. As far as I have seen, OpenLibrary does not provide that info
 - browse results with a pagination

# Notes
 - The performance of the OpenLibrary API is not amazing, please be patient when fetching the results
 - Thanks to Quentin Watt (https://twitter.com/QuentinWatt) for his React tutorials on Youtube. They are very up-to-date and are very well presented. Highly recommend!
